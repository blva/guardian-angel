# Guardian Angel

This work is a project developed by @blva and @geraldobraz applying the techniques and knowledge aquired on the classes: 
* Real Time Operational Systems Development 
* Embedded System Projects

## What is it?

Guardian Angel is a well known concept used to make buses safer. We developed this using ChibiOS as an RTOS and Arduino Uno as our platform.


## Requirements

* GCC
* Arduino UNO
* Buttons
* DC motor
* Buzzers

## How to run?

First, you need to clone our repository.

    git clone "https://github.com/blva/guardian-angel.git"

Then, on the downloaded folder, you should run:

    make install

This will clone the ChibiOS folder into your repository folder and then you will be able to run a make command. 

    make program
